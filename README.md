# RAG

* `Generative AI models` can only generate responses based on the data that they have been trained on! It means, they do not have the access to the external and uptodate data.
  
* `Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG)` is a framework that helps to improve the model output accuracy by combining retrival relevant data from the external sources in real time.

* `Generative AI platforms`: Hugging Face, Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, LangChain, and more.
* `RAG frameworks`: Pinecone, Chroma, Activeloop, LIamaIndex, and so on.
