* `Generative AI models` can only generate responses based on the data that they have been trained on! It means, they do not have the access to the external and uptodate data.
  
* `Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG)` is a framework that helps to improve the model output accuracy by combining retrival relevant data from the external sources in real time.

* `Generative AI platforms`: Hugging Face, Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, LangChain, and more.
* `RAG frameworks`: Pinecone, Chroma, Activeloop, LIamaIndex, and so on.

* RAG can only exist whithin an ecosystem.

# Three main RAG configurations:
  1. Naive RAG:
  2. Advanced RAG
  3. Modular RAG

- Python pipline for an entry-level naive RAG with keyword search and matching.
- Python pipline for an advanced RAG system with vector search and index-based retrieval.
- Build modular RAG that takes both Naive and advanced RAG into account.
